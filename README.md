# Image-Hashing-Baselines
Collect some deep image hashing methods and integrate them into my own baselines.

## Reference
This repository collects several open-source codes of the following methods. Thank the original authors for their contributions.

+ Auto-Encoding Twin-Bottleneck Hashing (CVPR20, TBH) [[Code]](https://github.com/ymcidence/TBH)
+ Self-supervised Product Quantization for Deep Unsupervised Image Retrieval (ICCV21, SPQ) [[Code]](https://github.com/youngkyunJang/SPQ)
+ Deep Unsupervised Image Hashing by Maximizing Bit Entropy (AAAI21, Bi-half) [[Code]](https://github.com/liyunqianggyn/Deep-Unsupervised-Image-Hashing)
+ Deep Hash Distillation for Image Retrieval (ECCV22, DHD) [[Code]](https://github.com/youngkyunJang/Deep-Hash-Distillation)
